    information ==> high level ( understandable by human)
    data ==> low level (not understable by human)
    database => data + storehouse
    Data: Data refers to any piece of information. It can be numbers, text, images, videos, etc. For example, your name, age, phone number, and address are all examples of data.

Database: A database is like a digital filing cabinet where you can store and organize your data. It's a structured collection of related data that is organized in a way that makes it easy to access, manage, and update.

DBMS (Database Management System): A DBMS is a software that helps you create, manage, and interact with databases. It provides tools and functionalities to store, retrieve, update, and delete data from the database. Examples of DBMS include MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System): An RDBMS is a type of DBMS that organizes data into tables, where each table consists of rows and columns. It follows the relational model, which means it establishes relationships between tables based on common attributes. This allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of data. Examples of RDBMS include MySQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.

Record ==> {A,B,C},{D,E,F} are two records( {X,Y,Z} is not a record)
Each record consists of three fields.
Key fields ==> X, Y, Z
Fields values ==> A, B, C, D, E, F
X is a key fields with A and D field values
"X" is indeed a field, acting as a key or identifier.
"A" and "D" are values associated with the field "X" for the respective records.
"A", "B", and "C" are the values of the fields under the keys X, Y, and Z for the first record.
"D", "E", and "F" are the values of the fields under the keys X, Y, and Z for the second record.
There are 3 fields: X, Y, and Z.
There are 6 field values: A, B, C, D, E, and F.
Each record consists of these fields and their associated values.
When you create a table in a database, you define the structure of the table, including the fields (columns) and their data types. Among these fields, you can designate one or more fields as key fields, which uniquely identify each record in the table.
When you insert data into this table, each row represents a single record, and each column contains a specific field's value for that record. The key fields, if specified, help uniquely identify each record.

So, in summary:

- The table consists of fields (columns).
- Each row of field values represents a single record.
- The key fields, if defined, help uniquely identify each record.
