Sure thing! Let's simplify it even further:

**Arrow Functions:**

- **How they handle `this`:** Arrow functions don't have their own `this`. Instead, they borrow it from the place they are written in. So, `this` in an arrow function refers to whatever `this` is outside the arrow function.
  
- **Syntax:** Arrow functions use a shorter syntax with the `=>` arrow symbol. They're great for small, quick functions.

- **Best for:** Using when you want `this` to refer to the same thing as it does outside the function. They're handy for short tasks like callbacks or methods in objects.

- **Arguments:** They don't have their own `arguments` object.

**Regular Functions:**

- **How they handle `this`:** Regular functions have their own `this`, which changes based on how they're called. If called as part of an object, `this` refers to that object. If called globally, `this` usually means the global environment.

- **Syntax:** Regular functions use the `function` keyword. They're a bit longer but very flexible.

- **Best for:** When you need to control what `this` refers to or when you're making bigger functions. They're good for a wide range of tasks, including object methods and constructor functions.

- **Arguments:** They have their own `arguments` object to access the values passed to the function.

In simple terms, arrow functions are like quick helpers that share `this` with their surroundings, while regular functions are more flexible and can stand on their own with their own `this`.

const obj ={
    object_ref: this, 
    rFunction: function() {
        console.log(this);
        bFunction=()=>{
            console.log(this);
        }
        bFunction();
    },
    aFunction: ()=>{
        console.log(this); 
    }
};

console.log(obj.object_ref);
obj.aFunction();
obj.rFunction();
 
output:
--------------------------------
window
window
{ object_ref: window, rFunction: [Function: rFunction], aFunction: [Function: aFunction] }
{ object_ref: window, rFunction: [Function: rFunction], aFunction: [Function: aFunction] }
