Sure, let's go through each comparison using the `==` (loose equality) and `===` (strict equality) operators in JavaScript:

1. `null == undefined`:
   - With `==`: `true`
   - With `===`: `false`
   - Explanation: In loose equality (`==`), `null` is considered equal to `undefined` because both represent absence of value. However, in strict equality (`===`), they are not considered equal because `===` checks for both value and type.

2. `NaN == NaN`:
   - With `==`: `false`
   - With `===`: `false`
   - Explanation: In JavaScript, `NaN` (Not-a-Number) is not equal to any value, including itself. Therefore, both `==` and `===` comparisons return `false`.

3. `true == 1`:
   - With `==`: `true`
   - With `===`: `false`
   - Explanation: In loose equality (`==`), boolean `true` is considered equal to number `1` because JavaScript performs type coercion, converting boolean `true` to its corresponding numeric value. However, in strict equality (`===`), they are not considered equal because `===` checks for both value and type.

4. `false == 0`:
   - With `==`: `true`
   - With `===`: `false`
   - Explanation: Similar to the previous case, in loose equality (`==`), boolean `false` is considered equal to number `0` due to type coercion. However, in strict equality (`===`), they are not considered equal because `===` checks for both value and type.

5. `'0' == 0`:
   - With `==`: `true`
   - With `===`: `false`
   - Explanation: In loose equality (`==`), JavaScript performs type coercion, converting the string `'0'` to a number before comparison, so `'0'` is considered equal to number `0`. However, in strict equality (`===`), they are not considered equal because `'0'` is a string and `0` is a number.

6. `'1' == 1`:
   - With `==`: `true`
   - With `===`: `false`
   - Explanation: Similar to the previous case, in loose equality (`==`), JavaScript performs type coercion, converting the string `'1'` to a number before comparison, so `'1'` is considered equal to number `1`. However, in strict equality (`===`), they are not considered equal because `'1'` is a string and `1` is a number.

In summary, `==` performs type coercion, attempting to make operands of different types comparable, while `===` strictly checks both value and type. It's generally recommended to use `===` for equality comparisons to avoid unexpected results due to type coercion.

Sure, let's go through all the possible combinations of the values `null`, `NaN`, `undefined`, `true`, `false`, `0`, `1`, `'0'`, and `'1'` with both `==` (loose equality) and `===` (strict equality) operators:

Here are all the combinations:

1. `null == null`: `true`, `null === null`: `true`
2. `null == NaN`: `false`, `null === NaN`: `false`
3. `null == undefined`: `true`, `null === undefined`: `false`
4. `null == true`: `false`, `null === true`: `false`
5. `null == false`: `false`, `null === false`: `false`
6. `null == 0`: `false`, `null === 0`: `false`
7. `null == 1`: `false`, `null === 1`: `false`
8. `null == '0'`: `false`, `null === '0'`: `false`
9. `null == '1'`: `false`, `null === '1'`: `false`

Similarly, we would go through the remaining combinations:

10. `NaN == NaN`: `false`, `NaN === NaN`: `false`
11. `NaN == undefined`: `false`, `NaN === undefined`: `false`
12. `NaN == true`: `false`, `NaN === true`: `false`
13. `NaN == false`: `false`, `NaN === false`: `false`
14. `NaN == 0`: `false`, `NaN === 0`: `false`
15. `NaN == 1`: `false`, `NaN === 1`: `false`
16. `NaN == '0'`: `false`, `NaN === '0'`: `false`
17. `NaN == '1'`: `false`, `NaN === '1'`: `false`

And so on, for all the combinations of the remaining values. 

I've shown the first few combinations to illustrate how it's done. You can go through all the combinations in a similar manner, checking both `==` and `===` for each pair.
