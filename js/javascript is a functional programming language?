Sure, I'd be happy to explain! In simple terms, being a functional programming language means that JavaScript treats functions as "first-class citizens." This means you can use functions just like any other data type, such as numbers or strings. You can pass functions as arguments to other functions, return them as values from other functions, and even assign them to variables.

Let me break it down with an example:

```javascript
// Define a function
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Pass a function as an argument to another function
function manipulateNumbers(a, b, operation) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

// Call manipulateNumbers and pass the 'add' function as the 'operation' argument
let result = manipulateNumbers(3, 4, add);
console.log(result); // Output will be 7
```

In this example, `add` is a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Then, we have another function called `manipulateNumbers` that takes three arguments: two numbers (`a` and `b`), and a function (`operation`). Inside `manipulateNumbers`, we call the `operation` function with the numbers `a` and `b`, effectively delegating the calculation to whatever function is passed as `operation`.

When we call `manipulateNumbers(3, 4, add)`, we're passing the `add` function as the `operation` argument. So, `add` gets called with `3` and `4`, and the result (`7`) is returned.

This is a fundamental concept in functional programming: functions can be passed around and used as data, allowing for flexible and powerful code structures.
