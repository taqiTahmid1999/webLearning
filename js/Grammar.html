<!--
    In JavaScript, identifiers are names given to variables, functions, labels, and objects. They can start with letters (both uppercase and lowercase), dollar signs ($), or underscores (_). Subsequent characters can also include numbers (0-9). Here's a breakdown:

- **Start characters**: (A-Z), (a-z), $, _
- **Subsequent characters**: (A-Z), (a-z), $, _, (0-9)

Examples of valid identifiers:
- `myVariable`
- `_myVar`
- `$myVar`
- `myVar123`
- `MyFunction`

Examples of invalid identifiers:
- `123myVar` (starts with a number)
- `my-Var` (contains a hyphen)
- `my Variable` (contains a space)

It's important to note that JavaScript is case-sensitive, so `myVariable` and `MyVariable` would be considered as two different identifiers.

DataType:
Data types

The latest ECMAScript standard defines eight data types:

    Seven data types that are primitives:

        Boolean: true and false.
        
        null: Represents an intentional absence of any object value. (Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.)
        undefined: A top-level property whose value is not defined.
        
        Number: An integer or floating point number. For example: 42 or 3.14159.
        
        BigInt: Introduced in ES2020, represents integers with arbitrary precision. It can hold larger numbers than the Number type. An integer with arbitrary precision. For example: 9007199254740992n.
        
        String: A sequence of characters that represent a text value. For example: "Howdy".
        
        Symbol: A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.
        and Object.Introduced in ES6, represents a unique and immutable value used as the key of an object property.
    
    Reference Data Types:

        Object: Represents a collection of key-value pairs. Objects can be created with curly braces {} and can contain properties and methods.

        Array: Represents a special kind of object used to store multiple values in a single variable. Arrays can contain elements of any data type.

        Function: Represents a reusable block of code that can be called with arguments and can optionally return a value.

        Date: Represents a specific moment in time, typically with properties and methods to manipulate dates and times.
        
        NaN: Not a Number

        Although these data types are relatively few, they enable you to perform useful operations with your applications. Functions are the other fundamental elements of the language. While functions are technically a kind of object, you can think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your script can perform.

        let num = 10; // Number
        let str = "Hello"; // String
        let bool = true; // Boolean
        let arr = [1, 2, 3]; // Array
        let obj = { key: "value" }; // Object
        let func = function() {}; // Function
        let date = new Date(); // Date
