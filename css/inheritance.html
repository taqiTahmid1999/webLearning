<!-- Inheritance

Inheritance refers to certain CSS properties that, when applied to an element, are inherited by that element’s descendants, even if we don’t explicitly write a rule for those descendants. Typography-based properties (color, font-size, font-family, etc.) are usually inherited, while most other properties aren’t.

The exception to this is when directly targeting an element, as this always beats inheritance:

index.html 

<div id="parent">
  <div class="child"></div>
</div>

/* styles.css */

#parent {
  color: red;
}

.child {
  color: blue;
}

Despite the parent element having a higher specificity with an ID, the child element would have the color: blue style applied since that declaration directly targets it, while color: red from the parent is only inherited. -->
