    Every html elements is box in a sense. How box will behave in web page is deepend two value, Outer display value and inner display value. 
    Outer display means how box will behave towards other boxes of it's sibling boxes. Block, inline, inline-block are some example.
    Inner display value determines how the elements of the box will be arranged into the box

    Flex: display:flex; is also a inner display value. flex means bendable wire ( it means elements will arranged, distributed through a single line which line is flexible)
    flex-flow: [flex-direction(main axis)] [flex-wrap(cross axis)=>wrap,nowrap,wrap-reverse(change the direction of cross axis)]
    justify-content: flex-items distribution accross main axis flex-start(starting of wire), evenly=> equal, around=> area, between=> space between items only
    align-items: every bends of flex considered as component in align items
    align-self: full wire


    flex-items property: order, flex-grow/shrink(main axis grow or shrink mainly good for responsive), flex-basis( better than min-width{it honors min-width but shrink when needed})

    flex: [flex-grow] [flex-shrink] [flex-basis]

=======

    flex: 1 => flex: 1 1 0 (flex basis 0% means width is been ignored)
    flex: auto => flex: 1 1 auto(flex basis auto means width is )
    
initial
The item is sized according to its width and height properties. It shrinks to its minimum size to fit the container, but does not grow to absorb any extra free space in the flex container. This is equivalent to setting "flex: 0 1 auto".

auto
The item is sized according to its width and height properties, but grows to absorb any extra free space in the flex container, and shrinks to its minimum size to fit the container. This is equivalent to setting "flex: 1 1 auto".

none
The item is sized according to its width and height properties. It is fully inflexible: it neither shrinks nor grows in relation to the flex container. This is equivalent to setting "flex: 0 0 auto".

<'flex-grow'>
Defines the flex-grow of the flex item. Negative values are considered invalid. Defaults to 1 when omitted. (initial is 0)

<'flex-shrink'>
Defines the flex-shrink of the flex item. Negative values are considered invalid. Defaults to 1 when omitted. (initial is 1)

<'flex-basis'>
Defines the flex-basis of the flex item. A preferred size of 0 must have a unit to avoid being interpreted as a flexibility. Defaults to 0 when omitted. (initial is auto)
