    Every html elements is box in a sense. How box will behave in web page is deepend two value, Outer display value and inner display value. 
    Outer display means how box will behave towards other boxes of it's sibling boxes. Block, inline, inline-block are some example.
    Inner display value determines how the elements of the box will be arranged into the box

    Flex: display:flex; is also a inner display value. flex means bendable wire ( it means elements will arranged, distributed through a single line which line is flexible)
    flex-flow: [flex-direction(main axis)] [flex-wrap(cross axis)=>wrap,nowrap,wrap-reverse(change the direction of cross axis)]
    justify-content: flex-items distribution accross main axis flex-start(starting of wire), evenly=> equal, around=> area, between=> space between items only
    align-items: every bends of flex considered as component in align items
    align-self: full wire


    flex-items property: order, flex-grow/shrink(main axis grow or shrink mainly good for responsive), flex-basis( better than min-width{it honors min-width but shrink when needed})

    flex: [flex-grow] [flex-shrink] [flex-basis]
